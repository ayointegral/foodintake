Instructions to the Engineering Team
1. Project Overview
Goal: We’re building a personalised health and nutrition planner that provides tailored meal plans, nutritional tracking, and integration with fitness data.
Approach: Start as a web application to test core functionality, then progress to a PWA and ultimately native mobile apps (using, for example, React Native or Flutter).

2. Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Web MVP

User Onboarding & Profile Setup: Collect basic info—age, gender, dietary preferences, goals.
Meal Plan Generation: Implement a basic algorithm to recommend weekly meal plans using pre-loaded recipes and a nutritional database.
Nutritional Analysis & Logging: Allow users to log meals, see daily calorie/macro breakdowns, and track progress.
Responsive Design: Ensure the web app is mobile-friendly from day one.
Phase 2: Integration & Enhancement

Fitness Tracking Integration: Sync with Google Fit/Apple Health APIs to adjust meal suggestions based on actual activity levels.
Educational Content: Embed a content library (articles, videos) and design a system for categorised nutritional tips.
PWA Conversion: Add service workers, offline caching, and installable app features to the web version.
Phase 3: Native Mobile App Development

Cross-Platform Framework Selection: Evaluate React Native or Flutter based on team preference and stack compatibility.
Feature Parity: Replicate all essential web features in the mobile app.
Push Notifications & Reminders: Add mobile-native enhancements to improve user engagement.
Payments & Subscriptions: Integrate native purchase flows for premium features.
Phase 4: Scalability & AI Integration

Machine Learning Enhancements: Introduce personalized recommendations, fine-tune meal planning algorithms based on user feedback and habits.
Community Features: Consider forums, recipe sharing, and group challenges in a future release.
Security & Compliance: Ensure compliance with local regulations for health data (if applicable), secure all API calls, and add robust authentication.
3. Technical Guidelines
Frontend: React (web), then React Native or Flutter (mobile).
Backend: Node.js or Django for scalable backend services.
Database: PostgreSQL for relational data (users, meals, logs), possibly a NoSQL store for quick searches.
APIs & Integrations:
Nutrition database (e.g., Edamam)
Fitness trackers (Google Fit, Apple Health)
Payment providers (Stripe, Apple Pay, Google Pay)
Testing & QA:
Use Jest or Mocha/Chai for unit tests.
Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end tests.
Implement CI/CD pipelines from the start.
4. Collaboration & Communication
Documentation: Maintain a central README and a wiki for APIs, endpoints, and development guides.
Issue Tracking: Use Jira or GitHub Projects for task assignment and progress tracking.
Code Reviews: Require a review before merging to main branch.
Stand-ups & Sprints: Weekly sprints with daily stand-ups to track progress and remove blockers.
